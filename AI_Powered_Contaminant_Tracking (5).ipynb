        "Water contamination is a critical environmental and public health issue. Contaminants such as industrial pollutants, agricultural runoff, and municipal waste infiltrate water systems, posing risks to ecosystems and human populations. Traditional contaminant source tracking methods rely on manual sampling, chemical analysis, and computationally expensive simulations, which are slow and often ineffective in real-time response scenarios. This project proposes an AI-powered system that leverages **Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)**, **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**, and **Game Theory** to **track contamination sources dynamically**, predict future pollution events, and **optimize response strategies**."
